# ✨ BroadcastMix – UI Feel & Tone Direction  
**Version 1.0 — October 2025**

---

## Introduction  
BroadcastMix exists in the space between **studio precision** and **human warmth** — an interface built not to impress, but to *belong* in the world of music and worship.

Its surfaces are quiet.  
Its light is patient.  
It’s a tool that never demands attention — only gives clarity.

The UI should feel like a **dimly lit room with glowing instruments**, where every detail exists for a reason, and silence is as meaningful as sound.

---

## 1. The Essence  

BroadcastMix is not about knobs and faders — it’s about **relationships**:  
between people, between sound and light, between stillness and motion.

It should feel **humanly minimal** — warm, restrained, deeply considered.

When you touch it, nothing “moves” in a showy way; it simply **responds**, the way an analog circuit breathes when voltage flows through it.

### Key words  
Calm · Grounded · Confident · Subtle · Human · Simple · Intentional

## 2. The Visual Atmosphere  

### Palette  
The world of BroadcastMix is dark — not black, but *dim charcoal*.  
Color lives only where meaning exists: in the groups, in the people, in the moment.  

- Backgrounds are matte and soft.  
- Accents feel internal, not painted on top.  
- Contrast guides the eye; light creates direction.

Think of **light under glass** — restrained, diffused, and purposeful.

### Typography  
Typography shouldn’t feel like labeling — it’s whispering.  
Use modern, rounded forms with generous breathing room.  
Every number, every name, every piece of data should appear **gentle but confident.**

## 3. Light as Emotion  

Light is not decoration. It is language.  

- A performer’s avatar glows faintly — *alive, present.*  
- A fader line brightens as it’s moved — *responsive, aware.*  
- The entire interface hums at a low, human frequency — not “animated,” but *awake.*

At idle, the system rests in stillness.  
When sound moves, light follows quietly.  
Motion never pulls attention away from the mix — it reflects it.

- When snapshots change, light subtly guides us into a new scene.

> **Guiding image:**  
> “You’re sitting at a console in a dark sanctuary. The lights are low, the band is playing, and the UI just gently breathes with you.”

## 4. The Geometry of Calm  

Everything in BroadcastMix is **geometry and rhythm**, not decoration.

- Vertical lines carry energy; horizontal lines carry balance.  
- Corners are rounded just enough to feel kind.  
- Whitespace is intentional — a pause between thoughts.

The interface feels *structured but not gridded*, human but not messy.  
Each section (avatars, faders, controls) aligns like a musical phrase — rhythmically, not mechanically.

---

## 6. Motion as Breath  

BroadcastMix does not “animate.” It **breathes.**  
Motion is always subordinate to rhythm — human, predictable, graceful.

- Hovering is a whisper.  
- Clicking is confirmation.  
- Nothing bounces, spins, or flashes.  
- Everything moves on smooth, gentle curves — just enough to feel alive.

Motion is the pulse behind stillness, not the focus of attention.

---

## 7. Human Presence  

The interface should feel like it was designed for *people, not channels.*

- Every performer has a circular portrait — small but personal.  
- Their faces ground the mix in reality; you’re not mixing “input 7,” you’re mixing *Josh’s vocal mic*.  
- Identity is sacred; it turns a console into community.

The faces are where the light begins — every channel’s life emanates from a person.

## 8. Tone of Experience  

| Attribute | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Professional** | Feels built for experts, but gracious to volunteers. |
| **Human** | Anchored in people, faces, and warmth. |
| **Minimal** | Every pixel earns its keep. |
| **Light** | Depth through light, not texture. |
| **Spiritual** | Quiet reverence, not religious iconography — the stillness of something purposeful. |

> **If Pro Tools feels like a lab, BroadcastMix should feel like a sanctuary.**

---

## 9. Emotional Targets  

| Moment | Feeling |
|--------|----------|
| Opening the app | “I can breathe here.” |
| Adjusting a mix | “Everything is under control.” |
| Watching meters move | “The mix is alive, but calm.” |
| Closing the project | “Nothing feels unresolved.” |

The emotional tempo should always land on *peaceful readiness.*

## 10. Summary  

BroadcastMix’s interface is an environment — a room you walk into, not a machine you manipulate.  
It combines the discipline of minimal design with the warmth of living light.

It should feel:
- Confident, not loud.  
- Alive, not busy.  
- Modern, but human.  
- Still, yet full of presence.
